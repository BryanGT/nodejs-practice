# Node.js Practice Project

This repository contains a practice project built with **Node.js**. It's designed to help you learn and experiment with core Node.js concepts such as modules, file system operations, asynchronous programming, and Express.js.

## 🚀 Project Goals

- Understand Node.js runtime
- Learn how to work with built-in modules
- Practice creating custom modules
- Implement basic API endpoints using Express.js (optional)
- Explore asynchronous patterns (callbacks, promises, async/await)

## 🧠 What You’ll Learn

- Node.js project structure
- `fs`, `path`, and other core modules
- Creating and using NPM packages
- Environment variables with `.env`
- Writing basic RESTful APIs
- Error handling and debugging
